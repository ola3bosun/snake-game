## 🧠 How It Works

- The snake is represented as an array of grid-based coordinates.
- Direction is controlled by keypress events.
- Food is placed at random positions that don’t overlap the snake.
- The game runs in a loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- If the snake hits the wall or itself — it’s game over, buddy.
